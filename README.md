# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network-in-PyTorch
 This project uses a CNN in PyTorch to classify CIFAR-10 images (60,000 images, 10 classes) with convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers. It involves data preprocessing, training with SGD and cross-entropy loss, and evaluating model accuracy on the test set.
